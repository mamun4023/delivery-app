            Ecommerce (or electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods or services on the
            Internet. It encompasses a wide variety of data, systems and tools for online buyers and
            sellers, including mobile shopping and online payment encryption. Most businesses with
            an online presence use an online store and/or platform to conduct ecommerce marketing
            and sales activities and to oversee logistics and fulfillment. According to eMarketer,
            in 2022, global retail ecommerce sales will surpass $5 trillion for the first time,
            accounting for more than a fifth of overall retail sales. And by 2025, total spending
            will exceed $7 trillion, despite slowing growth. To fully understand ecommerce, let’s
            take a look at its history, growth and impact on the business world. We will also
            discuss some advantages and disadvantages to ecommerce as well as predictions for the
            future. For more expert insights on the go, check out our biweekly audio series, the
